Indian Rupee Oswal Pumps IPO Home Loan Interest Rates Sensex Live Inflation Forecast. Founded in 2024 by Rishi Pardal and Shiva Subramanian, Biopeak provides personalised health services through in-house clinics. Accel founding partner Prashanth Prakash, Claypond Capital (the family office of Manipal Group chairman Ranjan Pai), and NKSquared, the investment vehicle of Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath. Biopeak combines molecular diagnostics, high-resolution imaging, and non-invasive testing to assess early signs of physiological changes. The company opened its first clinic in Bengaluru in March 2025. \"The moment is now to take control of your healthspan,\" Pardal said. Each client typically undergoes over six hours of multidisciplinary consultations. Biopeak primarily serves two categories of users: those seeking to improve overall health and performance, and individuals managing chronic or complex conditions that may not be adequately addressed by conventional treatment. The resulting health plan is revisited over time and refined through follow-up testing.\n"
